1) The console will log 3 as vars are not bound to the block scopes
2) The console will log 150 as vars are not bound to the block scopes
3) The console will log 150 as vars are not bound to the block scopes

7) The console will log 150 as final price is declared in the same level as line 14 thus it will log the last final price from the for looop which is 150.
8) This function will return an array of the final discounted prices as they get pushed in the for loop so they will be added.
9) This will return an error similar to question 5.
10) The console will log 3 as length is declared as a const being the length of the array passed which has 3 elements.
